A messy bedroom with two mattresses on box springs lying on a wood floor.
Two beds, each with a mess of items on them
The boys never make their beds or clean their room.
Two beds covered with a lot of things in a bedroom.
Two twin size beds are in disarray and separated by a small cluttered night stand.
