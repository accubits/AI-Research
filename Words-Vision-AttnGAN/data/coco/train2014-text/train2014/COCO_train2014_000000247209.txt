Old rundown commercial airplane sitting on its stomach with its wings off. 
An airplane on the runway with steps near it,
A large aircraft with an attached ladder for walking down
The airplane is sitting on the ground with it's wheels up.
 A plane has a set of steps so that the passengers may exit and return to the ground
