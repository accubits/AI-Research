A vase filled with yellow flowers sitting on a mantle.
A vase of daffodils on a mantle in a ray of sunlight.
Flowers in front of a mirror with lights in the background.
Yellow flowers stand out on the mantel in the dim light.
Sunlight peaks in a shadowy room to highlight flowers in a glass vase on a mantle with a mirror.
