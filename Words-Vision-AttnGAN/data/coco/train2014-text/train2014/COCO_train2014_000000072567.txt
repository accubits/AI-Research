Two men at some kind of festival 
Two guys at a fair in front of a lot of people.
A man with dark glasses and a funny looking thing on his head.
Two smiling men, one of whom sports a pink hat and tie, stand to the foreground of milling people and colorful decorations, suggesting a gala event. 
A man poses beside another man wearing a huge pink hat.
