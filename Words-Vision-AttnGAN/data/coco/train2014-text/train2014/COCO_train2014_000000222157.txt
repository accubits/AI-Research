a sign written in yellow that says righteous public republican glory hole 
A wooden object placed next to a tree on the side of the road
An old table by the road that has an arrow pointing to a hole in it that says righteous public republican glory hole.
A wooden box with a political message sitting in front of a tree on a sidewalk.
A brown sigh sitting on the side of a side walk advertising a republican glory hole.
