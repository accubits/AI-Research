The Big Ben clock tower sitting under the moon at night in London England.
A nighttime skyline shot of some buildings over looking the water.
A caste all it up, reflecting off of the water.
a large body of water in front of a long building at night 
THERE IS A IMAGE OF A LIGHTED CASTLE IN A TOWER CLOCK
