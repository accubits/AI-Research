A man stands near a long string of kites.
An older gentlemen standing outside next to a tall kite.
A man wearing a navy blue coat standing beside a string of kites flying in the wind.
Against a background of mostly sky and the suggestion of a field dotted at one end with trees, stands a frowning man with his arms crosses, who is looking away from a large string of multicolored kites floating right beside him. 
Kites I long column rising into atmosphere from the ground.
