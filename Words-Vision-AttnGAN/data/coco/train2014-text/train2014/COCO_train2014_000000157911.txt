A flat bread sandwich filled with cheese, tomato and green gel.
Some kind of weird food that I have never seen before,
A gourmet pita sandwich including cheese and tomato.
A piece of flatbread folded, with a piece of mozzarella cheese, a tomato slice and a vegetable in it.
A piece of pita bread is wrapped around cheese, tomato, and pesto.
