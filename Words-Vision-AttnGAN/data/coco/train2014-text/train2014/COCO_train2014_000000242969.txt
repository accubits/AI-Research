Sign warning about pets crossing the road outside..
A homemade sign stating to watch for pets.
A "pet crossing" sign with a peace sign on it is on a pole by a tree near the highway. 
The sign is made with white handwritten ink.
The original sign warning drivers about pets crossing the street was stolen so someone made their own.
