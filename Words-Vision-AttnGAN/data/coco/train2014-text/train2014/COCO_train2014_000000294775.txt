dinner time a white plate with little food on it and fingers with food in hand.
A hand holding a piece of food over a white sauce covered plate.
A green salad dish and a disk of some red sauce all lie on a dining table next to a glass of beer.
Half of the food in the picture is eaten.
Someone is just about to finish their last bite of a wrap.
