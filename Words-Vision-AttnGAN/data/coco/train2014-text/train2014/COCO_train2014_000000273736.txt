A picture of a sofa that is in a room.
This room contains a 3 section couch, daybed on the other side of the room and coffee table in between the two.
A living room filled with furniture and windows.
A glass sits on a chest in front of the couch. 
An eclectically styled living room looks very comfortable and is well lit; a dog is curled up sleeping on one of the couches.
