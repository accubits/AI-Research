It's a dark and dreary day on Main Street.
Traffic lights hung over an intersection of streets with very little traffic.
Traffic lights hang over cars parked on a street.
A street with park cars and a mailbox on the corner and lots of buildings.
Two traffic signals help to direct the flow of traffic.
