Cars are driving through the intersection underneath traffic signals. 
A bunch of stoplights that are hanging from a wire.
The view down a busy city street taken from a car window.
Driving through a small town turning left. 
The intersection of a city street that has cars traveling down one side of the street and fast food restaurants on the other side.
