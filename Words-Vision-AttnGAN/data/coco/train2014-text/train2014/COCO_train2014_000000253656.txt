a little yellow microwave on a white fridge
A mini-fridge and microwave inside of a hotel room.
a microwave on a refrigerator in the corner of a room
A microwave is sitting on top of a refrigerator. 
A very confined corner of a white-walled room shows a very low, or miniature bed, including  the headboard, and next to it a small shrink-wrapped plastic appliance, maybe a toy, and a plastic plate with a probably fake desert.
