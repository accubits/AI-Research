this old photo shows many military vehicles together
Old biplanes sitting in the sand by a group of men. 
This scene is reminiscent of World War I when fighters delivered bombs and had "dogfights" in the air.
A group of people walking around a dirt field near airplanes.
This is an old picture of an air flight take off strip.
