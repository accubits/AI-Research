Reminds me of my trip to Venice. Going under the bridge in a boat is so romantic.
A man walks outside a populated area while talking on his cell phone
A man on a cellphone near an arched bridge.
A person talking on a phone with others in the background 
A man is talking a cell phone outside around people.
