A group of people walking down a city street.
A group of people in colorful outfits walking together on the street.
A parade of people dressed in costumes and headgear with designed staffs they are holding.
A parade with people wearing very colorful clothing and holding signs.
I THINK THIS IS A BLACK HERITAGE PARADE
