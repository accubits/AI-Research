A shore is littered with a few birds as the ocean sits in the distance.
A man using a kite in the water near a grassy shore.
A body of water with a city in the distance.
People are para-sailing in the waters off this shoreline; a city looms in the distant background.
A painting of waves upon an ocean with tall grass and gold flowers
