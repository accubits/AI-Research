View from out the seat of horse drawn carriage with man holding wine glass
A couple drinking wine on a horse-drawn carriage ride through the countryside.
The picture is taken from inside of a horse drawn carriage.
I am unable to see the image above.
Two horses can been seen pulling a carriage from the passenger seat.
