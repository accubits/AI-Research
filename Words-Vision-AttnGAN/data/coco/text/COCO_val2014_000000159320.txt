Cars are travelling on a foreign city street.
a street full of vehicles around a bunch of buildings
There are a lot if cars parked in the street
An oriental city with traffic flowing in one direction and hardly any in the other.
Rush hour traffic in other countries is just as difficult as we face daily.
