A man on a cell phone looks across the road towards other people.
A picture of people crossing a large street.
The man holds a cell phone at a striped cross walk.
I hope that he doesn't get hit by a car while talking on his phone and walking across the street.
The man has a bag on his shoulder and a phone at his ear.
