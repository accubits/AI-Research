A living room filled with furniture and a bookshelf.
A floor is littered with papers, hangers and containers as a wooden shelf sits filled with books.
A messy bedroom with craft projects and hangars on the floor, chair, desk and bed.
This looks like the mess in a college student's dorm room.
A junky room with stuff all over the floor.
