The bed covered in many sheets and blankets is the only furniture in the room.
An unmade dirty bed in a filthy room with a window.
The old metal bed with dirty linens is the only furnishing in the abandoned room
a bed covered in heaps of rags and dirty bedding
there is a very large room with only a bed in it
