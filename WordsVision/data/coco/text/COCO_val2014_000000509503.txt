A traffic sign next to a road near a river.
Picture of three road signs, pedestrian/bicycles, up/down arrow sign, and no bicycling sign on a street.
An additional sign has been hung to prohibit bikes yet another way would have been to replace the original sign.
This is a road sign that says no bikes. 
We are looking at a car going down the road.
