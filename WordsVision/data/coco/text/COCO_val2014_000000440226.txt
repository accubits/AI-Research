An American flag is waving in the air
American flag flying in foreground of beautiful landscape.
People para sailing on a windy day with an American flag blowing.
A flag flying with kites all around it.
A tilted American flag is jutting into the foreground and flapping in a sky that also holds, what  appears to be para-sails, while a bridge marks the distance between a flat expanse of ground and rolling hills fronted by water.
