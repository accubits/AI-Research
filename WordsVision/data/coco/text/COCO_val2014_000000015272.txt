A red light is a wonderful contrast to the pink leaves on trees
A stoplight that has turned red on a road lined with trees that are in bloom.
A traffic light in front of trees with white blossoms.
a beautiful red bud tree full of flowers under a stop light 
A traffic light hanging in front of blossoming trees.
